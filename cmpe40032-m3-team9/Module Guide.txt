Grow and Shrink Update
1. Added functions on Paddle.lua
2. Added callings on PlayState when a player lost a life and got a certain score

Multiple Balls Update
1. Compose a powerup class framing ball or paddle.
2. Add a quad function for powerups on Util.lua
3. Declare it on main.lua 
4. Modify logics that includes self.ball on PlayState.lua, because you now have a table of balls.

Locked Bricks Update
1. Generate a quad for the locked brick in Util.lua
2. Declare it on main.lua
3. Add a brick randomizer to lock or not on brick.lua init (utilize math.random)
4. Add a logic on brick.lua hit() and render() if it's locked or not (boolean, etc.)
5. Add the skin of key powerups on the class by putting logic and using parameters' logic on playstate.lua
6. Optional on where to put, but I've put this on Util.lua: Add functions to be called on playstate.lua; spawning powerup and lockedBricked logic.
7. On PlayState.lua:
	-initiate table for the powerups and keys and timer to randomize the spawning
	-Add logics on when to spawn powerups on update.
	-Modify the collision logics by adding for loops since it's now a table
8. Optional: Render a key icon whenever you obtained the key powerup. I've imported a png named key.png,and it will appear near the hearts by making a function on main.lua framing like the renderHearts function.
